# Banking System

This is a simple banking system API built using FastAPI. It allows users to register, check user details, and perform money transfers between users. The system includes basic authorization and notification features.

## Instructions

- We have 2 types of users, ordinary users and shopkeepers, both have wallets with money and make transfers between them. We will only look at the transfer flow between two users.

- Requirements:

- For both types of users, we need Full Name, CPF, email and Password. CPF / CNPJ and e-mails must be unique in the system. Therefore, your system should allow only one registration with the same CPF or e-mail address.

- Users can send money (transfer) to shopkeepers and between users.

- Shopkeepers only receive transfers, they do not send money to anyone.

- Before finalising the transfer, an external authorising service must be consulted, use this mock to simulate (https://run.mocky.io/v3/8fafdd68-a090-496f-8c9a-3442cf30dae6).

- The transfer operation must be a transaction (i.e. reversed in any case of inconsistency) and the money must go back to the sending user's wallet.

- On payment receipt, the user or shopkeeper needs to receive notification (sending email, sms) sent by a third party service and eventually this service may be unavailable/unstable. Use this mock to simulate sending (http://o4d9z.mocklab.io/notify).
